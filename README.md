# number-system-converter
A C program which helps in converting between the 4 major number - Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal - amongst themselves.

This program takes a number in one of the 4 number systems and converts it into another system of your choice.
It employs various algorithms for both one-step and mutli-step conversions.

I have avoided the use of functions in this, so it might be redundant and repetitve.
